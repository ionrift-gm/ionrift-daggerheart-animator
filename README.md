# Ionrift Daggerheart Animator

**Connects Daggerheart to Automated Animations.**

![Demo](preview/demo.gif)

This module links generic Daggerheart attacks (Claws, Bite, Melee) to **Automated Animations**.

Most monster attacks aren't real "Items" in Foundry, so animations don't trigger. This module fixes that by constructing a temporary item during the roll.

## What it does
It bridges the gap by presenting a valid weapon during the roll, enabling hooks to fire. No configuration needed.

## Installation
1.  Install **Automated Animations** and **Daggerheart**.
2.  Install this module (`ionrift-daggerheart-animator`).
3.  Enable all three.

## Setup & Usage
1.  Open **Automated Animations** settings.
2.  Go to **Global Automatch**.
3.  Add entries for your common attack names (e.g., "Claws", "Bite", "Slam").
    *   *Tip: Use the "Melee" category for generic swings.*
4.  Roll an attack from a Daggerheart PC or NPC sheet.
5.  Receive animations!
